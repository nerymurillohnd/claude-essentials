# Svelte language server troubleshooting

> Verified against Claude Code 2.1.289, svelte-language-server 0.18.4 and svelte-check 4.7.6 on 2026-10-05. Precedence: the language-tools changelogs and the Claude Code docs win over this file.

## The LSP tool returns an error

Claude Code returns an error for each LSP call on a file whose server it cannot start. Check, in this order:

1. **Binary.** Check that the server is on the PATH:

   ```sh
   command -v svelteserver || echo "svelteserver not found"
   ```

   Missing means the user installs it globally with `npm install -g svelte-language-server`; in `/plugin`, the **Errors** tab shows `Executable not found in $PATH: "svelteserver"`. Tell the user; do not install packages without their confirmation.
2. **File type**: the plugin maps only `.svelte`. A `.ts`, `.js`, `.svelte.ts` or `.svelte.js` file needs a TypeScript language server the user installed separately.
3. **Session type**: cloud sessions never start plugin language servers. Use the project check from the SKILL.md (`npm run check`) there.
4. **Reload**: after installing the binary, the user runs `/reload-plugins` (a reload that adds the LSP tool for the first time needs `/reload-plugins --force`).

## No diagnostics appear after an edit

- If nothing appears even after a change that must break, prove the tools work before trusting a clean result: run the self-test, `"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/svelte-lsp-navigation/scripts/selftest.sh"` (see operations.md, "Prove it").
- The server starts on the first edit of a `.svelte` file, not at session start.
- Diagnostics after an edit appear as `Found N new diagnostic issues in M files`; only new issues are reported, so an unchanged error does not repeat.
- `claude --debug` logs `LSP server <name> failed to start: <reason>` when the server crashes at start.

## Results are empty or wrong

- Wrong position: positions are 1-based; place the position on the first character of the name. Use `documentSymbol` to get exact lines.
- Empty `workspaceSymbol`: the `query` was empty or too short.
- Stale results after moving, creating or deleting route files: a known server crash (see below). Ask the user to run `/reload-plugins`, then confirm with the project check (`npm run check`).
- Props typed `any` unexpectedly: if the component writes `$props<…>()` with type arguments, destructured props become `any` (known issue). Prefer `let { … }: Props = $props();`.

## False errors about generated types

`Cannot find module './$types'` or `Cannot find type definition file for '$app/types'` means SvelteKit's generated files are missing. Generate them before trusting diagnostics (the project's `check` script also runs this):

```sh
npx --no-install svelte-kit sync
```

 Since SvelteKit 3 the generated tsconfig lives in `node_modules/$app/tsconfig`, so dependencies must be installed.

## Known open issues

Checked open on 2026-10-05 in `sveltejs/language-tools`; re-check before citing them to the user:

| Issue | Symptom |
| --- | --- |
| #3108 | Server crashes or partly stops when route files are moved, created or deleted (SvelteKit 3) |
| #3080 | Reading the Svelte config from `vite.config.js/ts` can be wrong |
| #3124 | Type arguments on `$props()` make destructured props `any` |
| #3063 | TypeScript 7 crashes svelte2tsx and svelte-check; use `--tsgo` with TypeScript 6 and 7 installed |

Re-check an issue before citing it:

```sh
curl -sS 'https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/language-tools/issues/3108' | grep -m1 '"state"'
```
